# Old README

Issues tracker for projects which don't have a public issue tracker.

Inspired on <https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues>

Don't post security issues.

Prefix the issue title with the label of the product. Collaborators will later add the real issue label for you.

Always contact the enterprise after you post, and then post back their answers.

When contacting the enterprise, add a link back to the public post, to encourage them to start using an issue tracker, or to at least reply directly on the issue tracker to save you from copying their reply.

For new websites, also send a pull request that fills the table below.
